Introduction
================

motivation
----------

- The Bownian Motion process is a foundational block in quantitative finance
- Used extensively for
    - Pricing Derivative Products
    - Risk Management and Hedging
    - Portfolio Construvtion
- Also known as Wiener process

Definition
--------
- A *Wiener process* [^FinModels](Based on course script in Financial Models, J.M.Schumacher) ${W_t}(t >= 0)$ in continous time satisfes the following properties.

    (i) $W_0 = 0$.
    
    (ii) If $t_1 < t_2 <= t3 < t4$, then the increments $W_t_2 - W_t_1$ and $W_t_4 - W_t_3$ are independent.
    
    (iii) For any given $t_1$ and $t_2$ with $t_2 > t_1$, the increment $W_t_2-W_t_1$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $t_2-t_1$.

Assignment A 
=================

Simulations
-----------

Plot two sample paths of a discrete-time standard random walk. That is, plot
two trajectories of the process defned by the recursion $_Xk+1 = X_k + Z_k$ where
$X_0 = 0$ and the $Z_k$'s are independent standard normal variables. Take 200 steps.

Solution MATLAB Code
---------

The MATLab function $cumsum$ is used which helps avoid generating a time loop. The code is provided below. 

```
N=200; %number of steps
%initial values for the paths

path1(1)=0;
path2(1)=0;

%generating the paths
path1(2:N+1)=cumsum(randn(N,1));
path2(2:N+1)=cumsum(randn(N,1));

%output
figure 
hold on
plot([0:1:200],path1)
plot([0:1:200],path2,'r')
xlabel('Steps')
legend('path1','path2')
```

Assignment B 
=================

Problem
----------

Let $W_t$ be a Wiener process. Show that 

$$
\cov(W_t_1 ;W_t_2) = min(t1; t2).
$$

For every step in your reasoning, indicate which property of the Wiener process you use.

Solution
----------

Assume that $t_0 < t_1 < t_2$ where $t_0=0$. Then we can consider $W_t_1 = W_t_1 âˆ’W_t_0$ and $W_t_2$ as $W_t_2=(W_t_1-W_t_0)+(W_t_2-W_t_1)$ where $W_t_0=0$ from property (i) of a Wiener process. 

We wrote each of the random variables of the process as an increment. 
Those increments are independent (ii) and normally distributed (iii), with zero mean and variance that is equal to the time interval between the two random variables. So, if $W_t_0=0$, 

$$
\W_t_1~N(0,t_1)
$$

and 

$$
\W_t_2-W_t_1~N(0,t_2-t_1)
$$

The sum of two independent and normally distributed random variables is still a random variable, which is normally distributed with variance the sum of the variances of the aforementioned random variables: 

$$
\W_t_2~N(0,t_2)
$$

So, 

$$
\Cov(W_t_1,W_t_2)=E(W_t_1W_t_2)-E(W_t_1)E(W_t_2)=E(W_t_1W_t_2)=E(W_t_1(W_t_1+(W_t_2-W_t_1))=E(W_t_1^2)+E((W_t_1(W_t_2-W_t_1))=E(W_t_1^2)+E(((W_t_1-W_t_0)(W_t_2-W_t_1))=E(W_t_1^2)=Var(W_t_1)=t_1
$$

Analogously, if $0=t_0<t_2<t_1$, then $Cov(W_t_1,W_t_2)=E(W_t_2^2)=t_2$.

Consequently, $Cov(W_t_1,W_t_2)=min(t_1,t_2)$.
